There are basically two different types of arguments that you can add to your command line interface:

1. Positional arguments
2. Optional arguments

Positional arguments are the ones your command needs to operate.

eg: 
$ cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST

The first positional argument after the cp command is the source of the file you’re going to copy. The second one is the destination where you want to copy it.


Optional arguments are not mandatory, and when they are used they can modify the behavior of the command at runtime. In the cp example, an optional argument is, for example, the -r flag, which makes the command copy directories recursively.

Syntactically, the difference between positional and optional arguments is that optional arguments start with - or --, while positional arguments don’t.

To add an optional argument, you just need to call .add_argument() again and name the new argument with a starting -.



Positional arguments are arguments that can be called by their position in the function definition. Keyword arguments are arguments that can be called by their name. Required arguments are arguments that must passed to the function. 
Optional arguments are arguments that can be not passed to the function.
